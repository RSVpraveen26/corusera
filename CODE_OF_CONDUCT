. Our Pledge
We (maintainers, contributors, leaders, everyone in the community) promise to make the project a safe, welcoming, harassment-free place for everyone.
No matter your age, gender, race, disability, religion, nationality, looks, experience level — everyone is respected and included.
We promise to behave in ways that help build an open, friendly, healthy community.
2. Our Standards (or Encouraged / Restricted Behaviors)
Good behavior (do this!):

Use friendly & inclusive language
Be respectful to different opinions & experiences
Accept helpful criticism nicely
Focus on what’s best for the community
Show empathy to others

Bad behavior (don't do this!):

Insults, harassment, threats, discrimination
Trolling, personal attacks, unwanted sexual comments
Publishing private info without permission (doxxing)
Any other behavior that a normal professional person would find inappropriate

3. Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders / moderators are responsible for:

Explaining what good & bad behavior means
Taking fair action when someone breaks the rules (like warning, editing/removing comments, banning, etc.)
They have the right to remove or reject anything (code, issues, comments) that doesn't follow the rules, and they should explain why when possible.

4. Scope
This Code of Conduct applies:

In all project spaces (GitHub issues, Discord, forums, code reviews, etc.)
Also when someone is officially representing the project in public (conferences, social media, etc.)

5. Enforcement
(How to report & what happens)
If you see bad behavior: Report it to the project maintainers / moderators (usually via private email or a special contact).
All reports are taken seriously, reviewed confidentially, and handled fairly.
Leaders will decide what action to take (warning, temporary ban, permanent ban, etc.).
If someone keeps breaking rules or reports in bad faith (fake complaints), they might also face consequences.
6. Enforcement Guidelines (or Addressing and Repairing Harm — newer in v3.0)
This is like a "ladder" of actions:

First: private warning & education
Then: stronger actions if needed
Goal: repair harm, help people learn, and (when possible) bring them back safely to the community (restorative justice style)
Many projects customize this part with their own steps.
